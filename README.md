### Development

TWS is a simple Rails+Postgres app.

To get it set up locally, ensure you have the latest Ruby version as specified by .ruby-version and PostgreSQL (w. headers) installed, then:

```shell
bundle install

# Sync submodules
git submodule update --init

# create a `tws` role in postgres with the
# ability to create databases

createuser tws -d

# set user password to 123456 (change if desired)
echo "ALTER USER tws PASSWORD '123456';" | sudo -u postgres psql

# save the password (same as above) in the environment
# also add this to ~/.bash_profile so that it will always be set
export TWS_DB_PASSWORD=123456

# create the dev and test databases
rake db:create

# Load the schema
rake db:schema:load

# Run the App

foreman start -f Procfile-dev

# For Development
# Create some development data to play arond with
# This includes creating roles
# This will drop the database if it exists and create it again.
rake db:seed_dev
```

#### Mail

In development, all outgoing email will be intercepted by `mailcatcher`
and will be previewable at `http://localhost:1080`. The mailcatcher instance is
automatically started by the dev Procfile. You'll need to run `gem install mailcatcher`
though, since it's not part of the Gemfile.
