    %p 
      Each tea time is hosted by someone awesome (trust us, not just anyone
      gets to host tea time  :). If no times below suit you, we’ll release
      more soon and fire you an email then. 
    %p 
      In either case, you’ll soon receive an email with a link to this page
      for future access.
