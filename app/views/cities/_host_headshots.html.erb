        How else would someone end up regularly 
        bringing strangers together for conversations? 
        Before each of them were invited to community, 
        they were attendees that fed their tea times 
        with their questions, open-mindedness, and 
        presence.

          Every host in the community has played a huge role in making this movement come to life. You might not have seen tea times from these hosts in a bit, but without them, Tea With Strangers in <%= "#{@city.name}"%> wouldn't be where it is today.
