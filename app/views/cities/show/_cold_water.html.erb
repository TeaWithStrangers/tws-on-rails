    Dear <%= @city.name %>,
  </h2>
  <h3>
    We don't have an ETA for when we'll get to you yet. The moment we do, <%= @city.users.count %> of you will be emailed about it.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Right now, we're focusing on doing the best job we can in 
      <a href="http://www.teawithstrangers.com/NYC" target="_blank">New York</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.teawithstrangers.com/SF" target="_blank">San Francisco and the Bay Area</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.teawithstrangers.com/LONDON" target="_blank">London</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.teawithstrangers.com/BOS" target="_blank">Boston</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.teawithstrangers.com/CHI" target="_blank">Chicago</a>, and
      <a href="http://www.teawithstrangers.com/DC" target="_blank">DC</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That means finding amazing hosts, fostering a strong community amongst them, ensuring that tea times are happening regularly, and that every conversation inspires questions, new perspectives, and the reminder that we're far more the same than we are different.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're still trying to nail the formula to do this well, and when we have more of the puzzle made out, we'll bring Tea With Strangers to more cities.
  </p>
  <h3>
    For now, set your home city so you'll get that email too.

    If you're bummed about having to wait...
  </h3> 
  <p>
    Go to your local park, library, cafe, or any other community center and ask someone how they're doing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Tea With Strangers is a slightly less fear-inducing way of doing pretty much that, but you have all the courage you need to make this happen yourself. Really.
