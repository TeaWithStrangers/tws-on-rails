	<h2>You're awesome for being into this.</h2>
	<p>
		This is such a weird thing to be interested in, and that 
		you're here must mean you're at least curious. So thank you for, 
		well, being you!
	</p>
	<p> 
		Unfortunately, there are approximately <%=
		number_with_delimiter(User.all.count * (rand(100) + 1))%> people 
		who are also excited about tea time, and we're having trouble 
		stopping our website from melting.

	  We're very sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll shoot you an email when things
	  have calmed down.
