        You'd never think of yourself as a stranger. But everyone else does. You know your story. Your embarrassments. Your joy. Your idiocyncrasies — the thing that make you, you. But they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        And everyone has these — whether or not we know what they are. Everyone around you is a person, loaded with stories that you can't even begin to fathom. They're different from yours, but the fact that we all have them is what brings us together.
      </p>
      <p>
         In a stranger's story, we might discover parts of our own. And in seeing where a stranger is coming from, we might realize they're actually not so strange. But we don't discover much just by thinking about it. So let's find out.
