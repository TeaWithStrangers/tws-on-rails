Hey <%= @user.name %>,

Sorry to hear you won't be able to join for tea, but it's cool! Just for confirmation, here are the details of the tea time you just canceled for:

<%= render partial: "shared_mailers/info_nohost", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

It'd be awesome if you were able to find another time that does work for you (with me or with any of the other awesome hosts) so be sure to
[check out the schedule here](<%= url_for(controller: 'cities',
        action: 'show',
        id: @user.home_city.city_code,
        only_path: false,
        utm_campaign: 'cancelspot',
        utm_medium: 'email',
        utm_content: 'show') %>).

Hope your day is going beautifully. If not, grab a bar of chocolate and watch this: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gQLqv9f4o>.

Happy days!
<%= @tea_time.host.name %>
