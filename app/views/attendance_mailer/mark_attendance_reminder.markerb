<%= @host.nickname %>! Hope you had an awesome tea time. Quick housekeeping (before you get to the rest of your life):

[Mark attendance from your tea time](<%= url_for(controller: :profiles, action: :host_tasks, only_path: false) %>). Be sure to check off anyone you'd invite to make a great host!

Afterwards, send the attendees a little thank you note with all sorts of good vibes.

[All of it takes seconds](<%= url_for(controller: :profiles, action: :host_tasks, only_path: false) %>), and it helps us keep track of things hugely.

<% if @host.commitment_overview == HostDetail::REGULAR_COMMITMENT %>
  <% commitment = @host.commitment_detail %>
  [Oh, and get your next tea time up](<%= url_for(controller: :tea_times, action: :new, only_path: false) %>)! Youâ€™ve committed to hosting every <%= commitment %> weeks, so your next tea time should be sometime between now and <%= (Date.today + commitment.weeks).strftime("%B %e, %Y") %>. Theyâ€™re more likely to fill up the more ahead of time you post ðŸ¤“
<% else %>
  If youâ€™re feeling inspired, [schedule your next tea time](<%= url_for(controller: :tea_times, action: :new, only_path: false) %>)!
<% end %>
