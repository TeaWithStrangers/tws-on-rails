<%= @tea_time.host.name %>! Hope you had an awesome tea time. Quickly, before you get to the rest of your life...

**[Mark attendance from your tea time](NICKWHATSTHELINKFORTHIS?)**. Be sure to check off anyone you'd invite to make a great host!

Afterwards, send the attendees a little thank you note with all the good vibes.

[All of it takes seconds (and it's mobile friendly :)](...). Thanks!

Bleep bleep bloop,
