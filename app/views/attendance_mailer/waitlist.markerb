Just confirming that you've been added to the wait list for tea time with <%= @tea_time.host %>. 
Here are the details:

<%= render partial: "shared_mailers/info_nohost", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

If a spot opens up, you'll get an email from me so you can join in! It's likely someone cancels 
seat the day of the tea time, so try to keep an eye out for an email then!
