Just confirming that you've been added to the wait list for tea time.

Here are the details:

<%= render partial: "shared_mailers/info_nohost", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

If a spot opens up, you'll get an email from me so you can join in! It's likely someone cancels
their seat the day of tea time, so keep an eye out for an email then.

Your potential host,
<%= @tea_time.host.nickname %>
