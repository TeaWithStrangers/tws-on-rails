  Hey there, quick nudge. You mentioned youâ€™d want to host every <%= commitment %> weeks, and itâ€™s been <%= half_commitment %> weeks since your last tea (on <%= @tt.start_time.strftime("%B %e") %>). 

  ðŸ“… Try to [schedule your next tea time](<%= new_tt_url %>) sometime between now and <%= (@tt.start_time + commitment.weeks).strftime("%B %e") %>. 

  Fascinating conversations, childlike curiosity, and strangers await!

  Bleep bloop,

  PS If you need to adjust your commitment frequency, [you can do that here](<%= commitment_url %>).

  Just thinking about ya. Your last tea time was <%= commitment %> weeks ago.* 

  Life gets busy sometimes, but thatâ€™s usually a good sign to slow down with a warm drink and good company. [Tea time is a great time to do that](<%= new_tt_url %>).

  *You mentioned wanting to host every <%= commitment %> weeks on the website, so nowâ€™s a good time to uphold that commitment. If you want to change it, [feel free to do so here](<%= commitment_url %>).

  We spent a good five minutes thinking of puns for this last subject line. If you took the same amount of time, you could...

  - Think back to what a great tea time feels like
  - Reflect on friendships youâ€™ve made through Tea With Strangers
  - Meditate on a good question youâ€™d want to ask someone
  - [Schedule your next tea time](<%= new_tt_url %>)
  - Tell your friends to tell their friends that you havenâ€™t met yet about said tea time
  - Have a great conversation to look forward to

  We conveniently linked the one that our website can help with ðŸ¤“

  Your last tea time was on <%= @tt.start_time.strftime("%B %e") %>, <%= half_commitment * 3 %> weeks ago. If you still want to host every <%= commitment %> weeks, nowâ€™s a great time to [put a tea time up](<%= new_tt_url %>). If not, feel free to adjust your hosting commitment [here](<%= commitment_url %>).

  A generic reminder email!

  Youâ€™re signed up to host tea times every <%= commitment %> weeks, but your last one was <%= (Date.today - @tt.start_time.to_date).to_i / 7 %> weeks ago. 

  ðŸ™ˆ

  [Schedule your next tea time here](<%= new_tt_url %>). 
  (Or readjust your hosting commitment [here](<%= commitment_url %>).)

  Obviously we think one of those options is way cooler than the other, but weâ€™ll leave that to you. 

  See you soon!
