<% new_tt_url = url_for(controller: :tea_times, action: :new, only_path: false) %>
<% commitment_url = url_for(controller: :registrations, action: :edit, only_path: false) %>

Just a nudge in case you filed the last email away to come back to later. 

ðŸ“… [Hereâ€™s that link to schedule a tea time](<%= new_tt_url %>)

We wonâ€™t email you again for a few months about hosting tea time, but if you like reminders, you should set a hosting commitment on the website. [Hereâ€™s the link to do that](<%= commitment_url %>).

When you do, youâ€™ll get emails in accordance with your commitment reminding you to host tea times when youâ€™re able to. You can adjust or eliminate the commitment whenever.
