Hey hey, 

You were on the waitlist for a tea time today, and sadly (or beautifully,
depending on how you see it :), spots didn't open in time for you to jump in.  

Bad news? Tea time was probably awesome.  

Good news? There are plenty where that came from. **[Grab a seat at another tea
time here.](<%=url_for(controller: 'cities', action: 'schedule', id:
@tea_time.city.city_code, only_path: false, utm_campaign: 'followupwaitlist',
utm_medium: 'email', utm_content: 'schedule') %>)**  

Bleep bleep bloop,
