Sadly, we never got a chance to get you off the waitlist for the tea time you 
signed up for. It just happened, and something tells us it was awesome.

Well, actually, this email is prewritten, so we don't actually know how it went. 
But one thing's for certain â€” a few folks open-minded enough to sit around with 
a group of strangers just expanded their minds and now understand things 
they didn't even conceive of two hours earlier. Pretttty cool.

Since you were on the waitlist, you weren't one of them, but no worries! 
You can be! **[Let's find a tea time that suits your schedule here.](<%=url_for(
