Just noticed that you signed up for a tea time, but wanted to take a sec to fill you in on what tea time is about. The biggest scheme of TWS is that it has nothing to do with tea. But I did want to include the gif above just because it's cool (and a little bit trippy.)

But I did want to take a hot sec to share what tea time actually about to make sure we're all on the same page.

Tea time is a conversation between a few strangers pulled together by a host.

**What's tea time about?**

 - Sharing stories. Seeing little snippets of each others' lives makes it unusually obvious how much we share.
 - Asking questions. The best conversations are covered in 'em.
 - Giving. Whether it's a listening ear, eye contact, or a fat hug, think generosity.  
 - Staying small. Big parties are usually better for small talk. Tea time is a small party to keep the talk, well, bigger than small.

**What isn't tea time about?**

 - Flaking. Well, you can flake, but just do it sooner rather than later. Signing up holds the spot for you, but it also holds the spot from others!

In short, tea time is hugely about just being you and not thinking too hard about it all. It's a good thing :).

Now come through and let's find a time that you can join for tea? <<%=url_for(controller: 'cities',action: 'schedule',id: @user.home_city.city_code,only_path: false) %>>.

All good things,  
Ankit, a host at TWS

P.S. If you want to [host tea time where you are](http://teawithstrangers.com/hosting), get involved in another way, or just exchange digital high fives, you can (and absolutely should) reply to this note.
