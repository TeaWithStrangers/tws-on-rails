Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!

Just confirming the tea time you just signed up for! I included a calendar event to this email so that you don't forget. If you hit the 'Add to Calendar' button, it'll be on your cal.

For good measure (in case you really hate calendars for some reason), tea time deets are:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info_nohosts", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

Can't wait to have you for tea!

Cheers,  
<%= @attendance.tea_time.host.name %>

P.S. If you need to bail, take care of it on the sooner side so your spot can be opened for someone else! You can do it super easily by logging into the site and going to the 'Account' link.

In case you forgot your password, [you can reset it with ease here](http://www.teawithstrangers.com/users/password/new>).
