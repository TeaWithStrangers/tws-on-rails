Just wanted to send a quick thank you for joining on behalf of TWS and drop a note about a few things:

1. **[Come to tea time again](<%=url_for(controller: 'cities', action: 'schedule', id: @tea_time.city.city_code, only_path: false, utm_campaign: 'followupattendance', utm_medium: 'email', utm_content: 'schedule') %>)**. You can and should, and you can be sure that every tea time is different. Never gets dull (trust me – I've hosted over 150 of these myself, and I'm still not bored!) [You can find more available tea times here](<%=url_for(controller: 'cities', action: 'schedule', id: @tea_time.city.city_code, only_path: false, utm_campaign: 'followupattendance', utm_medium: 'email', utm_content: 'schedule') %>).
2. **[Like Tea With Strangers on fb!](http://www.facebook.com/teawithstrangers)**. We share awesome content that'll make you laugh, think about relationships, and making our lives better on the day-to-day.
3. **[Join the tea time group on fb!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/501352496639933/)**. It's a good place to meet and talk to other people who've come to tea times themselves.
4. **Tell your friends about it.** That could mean sending them some snail mail or [shouting from the mountaintops...of Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.teawithstrangers.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home?status=I%20can't%20tell%20you%20how%20awesome%20tea%20time%20was%20with%20@teawstrangers.%20You've%20gotta%20go%20to%20one:%20http://teawithstrangers.com). Your friends will probably think it's cool that you went, and the more diverse perspectives that show up to tea time, the better the world looks. I don't know about you, but a good looking world doesn't sound too shabby to me. 

Sound good?

Hope you're having the greatest day of all time.

All good things,
