![HEYTHANKS](http://media.giphy.com/media/ip6n2oVNZBHiM/giphy.gif)

Just wanted to send a quick thank you for joining for tea time. [You can (and should!) come again](<%=url_for(controller: 'cities', action: 'show', id: @tea_time.city.city_code, only_path: false, utm_campaign: 'followupattendance', utm_medium: 'email', utm_content: 'show') %>). Every tea time is a hugely different experience â€” especially if you pick one with a new host.

You can reach out to anyone from your tea time by grabbing their emails on via [your tea time history](<%= history_url %>).

Sound good? Good! Hope you're having the best day ever.

Bleep bleep bloop,
