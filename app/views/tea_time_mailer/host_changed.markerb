Hey <%= @new.name %>,

Just letting you know you're now the host for this tea time: [<%= @tt %>](<%= url_for(controller: :tea_times, action: :show, id: @tt) %>).

Please speak with <%= @old.name %> if they didn't discuss this with you! (It's probably a mistake).

Cheers,
The Robots at Tea With Strangers
