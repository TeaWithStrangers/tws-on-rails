Hey <%= @new.name %>,

Just letting you know you're now the host for this tea time: [<%= @tt %>](<%=
url_for(controller: :tea_times, action: :show, id: @tt, only_path: false) %>).

Please speak with <%= @old.name %> if they didn't discuss this with you! (It's probably a mistake).

Bleep bleep bloop,
