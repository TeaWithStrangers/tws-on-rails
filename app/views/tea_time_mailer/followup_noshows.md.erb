Apparently, you weren't able to make it to tea time earlier, which is a shame, but it seems like you weren't able to cancel your spot on the site earlier.

On a personal level, I get it. Canceling something takes a lot more effort than doing nothing. [Doing *anything* is so much harder than doing nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHSafx4eASg). 

But here's the thing — if you don't show up, things get awkward!  

 - You leave the rest of the group hanging! 
 - You take a spot from someone else that could've come.
 - The host is holding their breath and looking at the door every 30 seconds wondering if the next person who walks in is you.
 - The first half hour of conversation is spent wondering if you'll be able to catch up all right (which is an awful feeling of restraint)
 - I spend my entire night wondering what I could've done to make accountability a little more emphasized on the website.
 - More of these automatic passive-aggressive emails get sent out.
 - Also, tea time was probably awesome and you missed out which hurts me to even say because the reason TWS exists is to offer this experience to everyone in the most accessible way possible. 

It's not a huge deal, but imagine a world where we all just didn't show up to stuff after saying we would! That world sucks.

Let's make sure that world doesn't exist! [Join for tea time again sometime](<%=url_for(controller: 'cities',action: 'schedule',id: @user.home_city.city_code,only_path: false) %>) and we'll hug it out and call it even, yeah?

Hope you're having the greatest day of all time.

All good things,
Ankit, one of the hosts at TWS

P.S. I'd love for you to reply to this email and share whatever it is that you're thinking right now.
