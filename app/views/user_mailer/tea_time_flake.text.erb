Hey <%= @user.name %>,

Just a note to confirm that you won't be joining for the following tea time:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

It'd be awesome if you were able to find another time that does work for you, so be sure to check out the schedule here: <%= 
url_for(controller: 'cities',
        action: 'schedule',
        id: @user.home_city.city_code,
        only_path: false) %>.

In case you forgot your password, you received it in the first email we sent you (at the moment, you'll need to log in to reschedule your tea time). You should be able to find it easily by searching 'high fives from tea with strangers' in your inbox. If you can't, reply to this and we'll sort you out :).

Hope your day is going beautifully. If not, grab a bar of chocolate and watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gQLqv9f4o. 

Happy days! 
The Tea With Strangers team
