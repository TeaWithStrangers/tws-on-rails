Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!

One more reminder about tea time coming up super soon! Here are the details:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info_nohost", locals: {tea_time: @attendance.tea_time} %>

See you soon!  
<%= @attendance.tea_time.host.name %>

P.S. If you need to cancel, it's super easy. Just log into the site, click 'Account' and 
hit the 'Cancel' button. This way, your spot can be opened up for someone else.
