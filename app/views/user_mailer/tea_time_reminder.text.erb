Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!

Just wanted to shoot you a quick reminder about your upcoming tea time! If you
haven't already, could you reply to this just to confirm that you'll be there?

For a refresher, here are the details:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info", locals: {tea_time: @attendance.tea_time} %>

Super excited to see you!

Cheers,
<%= @attendance.tea_time.host.name %>

P.S. If you need to cancel last minute, it's super easy. Just log into the site,
clicking 'Account' and clicking the 'Cancel' button. This way, your spot can be
opened up for someone else.
