Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!

Just confirming the tea time you just signed up for! Attached to this email is a calendar event so that you don't forget. If you hit the 'Add to Calendar' button, it'll be on your cal.

For good measure (in case you really hate calendars for some reason), tea time deets are:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

Can't wait to have you for tea!

Happy days,
The Tea With Strangers family
