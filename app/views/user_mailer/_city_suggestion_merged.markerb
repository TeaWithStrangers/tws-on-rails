We saw your city request and thought it made sense to set your city as [link_to
@city.name](<%= forbes_city_url(@city) %>). This is most often because the city
you submitted is in the same metropolitan area as another one or because the one
you submitted is a repeat of the one we have on the site.

Check it out and tell everyone you know about it. You can do all of that right
here: [link_to <%= @city.name %>](<%= forbes_city_url(@city.id) %>)

If you think this may have been a mistake, just reply to this note and let us
know. Weâ€™ll get you sorted!
