Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!
 
Ankit here, one of the hosts behind Tea With Strangers. 

Just wanted to thank you for signing up. The world is better when we take a second to understand each other, and that's what we're going after with tea time. Thanks for being a part of it.

Since you're in <%= @user.home_city.name %>, we're not ready just yet to have tea time. BUT maybe you could help speed things along. Two things we need more than any:

1. Great hosts. If you or someone you know would make a great one, [check this out](http://teawithstrangers.com/hosting) and hit us up.
2. Great people like yourself to join for tea time! So share TWS with your pals on facebook and twitter :)

And while you're on facebook, show us some love and 'Like' our page. You know how social media affirmation works: <http://facebook.com/teawithstrangers>. 

Super love,  
Ankit

P.S. If you want to learn more about what this is about, talk about how to get involved, exchange digital high fives, whatever, you can (and absolutely should) reply to this note.
